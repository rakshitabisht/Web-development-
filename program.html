        <br>

      <li><strong>Uttarakhand Blooms as an Organic State, Gets Rs 1500 Crore Boost from Centre!</strong></li>
      <br>
      <br>
       1. In order to boost organic farming in Uttarakhand and develop it as a <strong>‘fully organic state,’</strong>,the Centre has sanctioned Rs 1,500 crore for the next three years.
     <br>
     <br>
    </ul>

     <ul>
     <li><strong>Uttarakhand aims to certify 31% of agricultural land as organic in 2021</strong></li>
     <br>
     <br>
    1.The Uttarakhand government has a target to certify 31% of the total agricultural land as organic in 2021 
    to expand the area under organic farming.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.It was also informed about the same while addressing a gathering at the seminar on State Focus Paper 2021-22 by the National Bank 
    for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) with a theme of <strong>collectivisation of agricultural produce for enhancing farmers’ income.</strong>
   <br>
   <br>
   3.At present,the total area certified for organic farming is about 23 per cent, which would be increased to 31 per cent by the end of 2021.
    This is a significant move because, <strong>40 per cent of the country’s total organic farming is being done in Uttarakhand 
    which is also the first state in the country to have an act on organic farming.</strong>
