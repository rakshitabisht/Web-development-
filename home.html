        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> 
           Organic farming system in India is not new and is being followed from ancient time. Organic farming can be defined as an agricultural process that uses biological fertilisers and pest control acquired from animal or plant waste . 
           Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm.
           Modern organic farming was developed as a response to the environmental harm caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers in conventional agriculture, and it has numerous ecological benefits.
           The general principles of organic production, from the Canadian Organic Standards (2006), include the following:
         <ul>
        <li>Protect the environment, minimize soil degradation and erosion, decrease pollution, optimize biological productivity and promote a sound state of health.</li>
         <li>Maintain long-term soil fertility by optimizing conditions for biological activity within the soil.</li>
        <li>Maintain biological diversity within the system.</li>
         <li>Recycle materials and resources to the greatest extent possible within the enterprise.</li>
         <li>Provide attentive care that promotes the health and meets the behavioural needs of livestock.</li>
        <li>Repare organic products, emphasizing careful processing, and handling methods in order to maintain the organic integrity and vital qualities of the products at all stages of production.</li>
        <li>Rely on renewable resources in locally organized agricultural systems</li>
         </ul>
           <br>
           <strong>CHARACTERSTICS OF ORGANIC FARMING </strong>
           <br>
           <ul>
            <li>Maximum but sustainable use of resources.</li>
            <li>
                Minimal use of purchased inputs, only as complementary to local resources.
            </li>
            <li> Ensuring the basic biological functions of soil-water-nutrients-human continuum.</li>
            <li>
                Maintaining the diversity of plant and animal species as a basis for ecological balance and economic stability.
            </li>
            <li> Creating an alternative overall landscape which give satisfaction to the local people.</li>
                
            <li>Increasing crop and animal diversity in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, integrated crop-livestock systems etc.., to minimize the risk.</li>
            
           </ul>
           <strong>BENEFITS OF ORGANIC FARMING </strong>
           <ul>
            <li> Environment-friendly.

              <strong> PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIC FARMING </strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              Organic farming methods accord with the four basic principles that reveal their essence: <Strong>health, ecology, fairness, and care.</Strong> are the driving force of the concept, interrelating and enhancing each other.
              <ul>
              <strong><li>Health</li></strong>
              The principle of health in organic farming suggests avoiding dangerous chemicals leaving poisonous residues that have a negative impact on multiple levels, affecting microscopic soil organisms, crops, animals, and humans.
             </ul>
             <ul>
              <strong><li>Ecology</li></strong>
             The principle of ecology in farming involves utilizing environmentally friendly techniques like the ones fostering soil quality (preventing depletion, erosion, degradation) or eliminating nature pollution. 
             It also means providing favorable living conditions for all ecosystem members since they closely interconnect. Eco-practices in agriculture maintain the proper balance and save natural resources.
             </ul>
            <ul>
             <strong><li>Fairness</li></strong>
             The principle of fairness in organic farming advocates a decent and respectful attitude to all participants of the business: farmers, suppliers, traders, consumers. It promotes appropriate working and living conditions and supports people’s needs for sufficient supplies of quality food products.
            </ul>
            <ul>
             <strong><li>Care</li></strong>
             The principle of care in agriculture encourages sparing consumption of resources with upcoming generations and nature in mind. Applied farming technologies should be thoroughly assessed as to negative consequences. Precaution and timely risk management must govern any decision making.
            </ul>

            <strong> HOW TO START AN ORGANIC GARDEN AT HOME </strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              You've been trying to eat more organic foods, both to decrease the amount of pesticides you and your family consume and to help protect the environment. Luckily, there's a way to grow your own delicious, fresh produce while having fun and learning at the same time: <strong>ORGANIC GARDENING</strong>
              Don't know where to start? It is possible to hire someone to install and maintain a beautiful organic garden for you, but most of us can roll up our sleeves with a surprisingly low amount of effort. Remember, you can start small, even with just a single plant or two.
            <ul>
                <strong><li>Preparing the soil</li></strong>
                <br>
                The best way to gauge the quality of your soil is to get it tested. You can get a home testing kit, or better, send a sample to your local agricultural extension office.
                Even if you don't have time for testing, you'll have to make sure your soil has plenty of humus — the organic matter.You'll also have to mix in compost, leaf and grass clippings, and manure.
            </ul> 
                <div class="thumbnail">
                <img src="1.jpg" alt="Organic Image" class="imgFluid">
    
                <ul>
                <strong><li>Making good compost</li></strong>
                <br>
                <strong>Spread compost around plants or mix with potting soil — it's hard to use too much!</strong><br>
            The best compost forms from the right ratio of nitrogen- and carbon-rich organic waste, mixed with soil, water, and air.<br> 
            1.To get started, measure out a space at least three feet square. Your compost heap can be a simple pile.<br>
            2. Add alternating layers of carbon (or brown) material — leaves and garden trimmings — and nitrogen (or green) material — such as kitchen scraps and manure, with a thin layer of soil in between.<br>
            3. Top off the pile with four to six inches of soil. Turn the pile as new layers are added and water to keep (barely) moist, in order to foster microbe action.<br>
            4. A properly maintained compost pile shouldn't smell. If it does, add more dry carbon material (leaves, straw, or sawdust) and turn it more frequently.<br>
              </ul> 
                <div class="thumbnail">
                <img src="2.jpg" alt="Organic Image" class="imgFluid">
    
                <ul>
                <strong><li>CHOOSING THE RIGHT PLANTS</li></strong>
                <br>
                If you're buying seedlings, look for plants raised without chemical fertilizers and pesticides. A great place to look is at your local farmers' market, which may also have native plants and varieties well-suited to your area.
                Many things are best grown from seed, including sunflowers, coriander, sweet peas, squash, and cucumbers etc.
              </ul> 
                <div class="thumbnail">
                <img src="3.jpg" alt="Organic Image" class="imgFluid">
           
    
                <ul>
                <strong><li>PLANTING CROPS</li></strong>
                <br>
                Plants that you will be harvesting, such as vegetables or cutting flowers, should be grouped tightly in beds that you don't walk on. 
                Raised beds work great. Grouping reduces weeding and water waste, and helps you target compost and nutrients. Ample space between rows helps promote air circulation, 
                which repels fungal attacks.
                </ul> 
                <div class="thumbnail">
                <img src="4.jpg" alt="Organic Image" class="imgFluid">
    
                <ul>
                <strong><li>WATERING</li></strong>
                <br>
                The best time to water plants is usually in the morning because mornings tend to be cool with less winds, so the amount of water lost to evaporation is reduced.
                If you water in the evening, plants stay damp overnight, making them more likely to be damaged by fungal and bacterial diseases.
                </ul>

                <strong><li>WEEDING</li></strong>
                <br>
                No matter where you live, you'll still get weeds.
                Reduce the number of weeds you have to contend with by applying mulch, which also helps to protect the soil. Organic mulch and burlap can work in a pinch. 
                Straw is cheap but doesn't last long. Wood chips are nice, but can get pricey. Many people opt to use lawn clippings, although it should be noted that because they are high in nitrogen, 
                clippings should only be used on plants that need a lot of the nutrient, such as squash and lettuce.
                </ul>

                <ul>
                <strong><li>PROTECTING PLANTS WITHOUT PESTICIDES</li></strong>
                <br>
                If your garden is being assaulted by pests, it may be a sign of other problems, so the first thing you should do is make sure plants are getting enough light, nutrients, and moisture.
                It's a good thing to foster natural predators in your garden, such as frogs, toads, lizards, birds, and even bats. 
               Leave a small source of water out to attract friendly predators. 
               It's also a good idea to grow plants with small blossoms, such as sweet alyssum and dill, which attract predatory insects. .
               </ul>

                    <img src="7.jpg" alt="Organic Image" class="imgFluid">
    
                <ul>
                <strong><li>HARVESTING</li></strong>
                <br>
                Generally, the more you harvest, the more your plants will produce for you.
                During peak harvest season, you'll likely find that it's best to check your garden every day.
                Like,gather all herbs except basil in mid-morning, shortly after dew has dried.
                Harvest basil in the late afternoon, since it will last longer after some time in the sun. 
                If you get too much bounty, remember you can also freeze, store some types of produce in a root cellar, or take up canning.

                <strong><li>CLEANING UP</li></strong>
                <br>
                If you notice sick plants either during the season or at the end of the year, make sure you pull up the entire organism.
                It's better to chop off annuals instead of yanking them out. That way you'll leave soil intact, and help prevent weeds from gaining a foothold.

         <strong> SCOPE OF ORGANIC FARMING IN UTTARAKHAND</strong>
         <br>
         <br>
         The scope of Organic Farming in Uttarakhand is at its best since the farmers use the traditional approach to farming, i.e. rain-fed agriculture, 
         without using pesticides or fertilizers. Along with the common farmers, the government is continuously taking active measures to make the state 
         fully organic and enhance the productivity level along with this.
         <ul>
           The following pointers make it more evident that the future of organic farming in Uttarakhand is much brighter:
           <br>
           <br>
           1.Uttarakhand has officially certified 23% of its total land for organic agriculture but the government is determined 
           to increase the certified percentage of land for organic farming up to 31% in the state by the end of 2021.
           <br>
           <br>
           2. In 2019, keeping in view the prospects and scope of farming, the Uttarakhand government has approved India’s 
           first organic agriculture act.The act states the penalties applicable if farmers used pesticides or any kind of
            banned fertilizer for their crops.
            <br>
            <br>
           3.It is considered admirable that about 40% of the organic farming done in India is done by Uttarakhand and the 
           state sees a future of being the <strong>'Fully Organic state’</strong> in the next 5 years.
           <br>
           <br>
           4.The Uttarakhand government is all set to give a boost to the organic market with the help of Self-Help Groups(SHGs) 
           that would be under government control to make the farmers aware of the importance of organic farming and help them enhance
          their production scale.

       <strong> FUTURE OF ORGANIC FARMING IN UTTARAKHAND</strong>
       <br>
       <br>
      There is a long-term future for organic farming in Uttarakhand due to its numerous benefits to both producers and consumers. 
      With the consumers becoming more conscious of health and sustainable development, the state of Uttarakhand is progressing by 
      leaps and bounds for attaining a fully organic status. 
       <ul>
        <br>
   
       1.Farmers of Uttarakhand, in assistance with the Government, are continuously exploring the opportunities of organic farming. 
        <br>
        <br>
       2.The government is converting particular districts under the organic criteria where the farmers would only be allowed 
       to grow organic crops and the farmers are also welcoming towards this decision.
         <br>
         <br>
       3.Being a highly visited destination by tourists, Uttarakhand holds an upper hand in advertising their 
       organic product through the word of mouth by the visitors.
